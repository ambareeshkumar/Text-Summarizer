# Text-Summarizer

This project is a text summarization tool that aims to condense large amounts of text into shorter, more concise summaries. It utilizes various workflows to achieve this goal.

## Workflows

1. **UPDATE CONFIG.YAML**: Update the configuration file `config.yaml` to specify the desired settings for the text summarization process.

2. **UPDATE PARAMS.YAML**: Update the parameters file `params.yaml` to define the specific parameters for the text summarization algorithm.

3. **UPDATE ENTITY**: Update the entity file (`entity.py`) to provide the variables for classes and functions used in the text summarization process.

4. **UPDATE CONFIGURATION IN SRC CONFIG**: Update the configuration in the source code configuration file to ensure that the text summarization process uses the correct settings.

5. **UPDATE CONSTANTS**: Update the constants file to define any necessary constants or variables used in the text summarization process.

6. **UPDATE COMPONENTS**: Update the components file to modify or add any necessary components for the text summarization algorithm.

7. **UPDATE PIPELINE**: Update the pipeline file to define the sequence of steps involved in the text summarization process.

8. **UPDATE MAIN.PY**: Update the `main.py` file to execute the text summarization process and generate the summary.

9. **UPDATE APP.PY**: Update the `app.py` file to integrate the text summarization functionality into an application or user interface.

Feel free to customize and modify the code and files according to your specific requirements.

For more details and usage instructions, please refer to the individual files and their respective documentation.

Happy text summarizing!
